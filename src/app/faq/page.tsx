    title: "Booking & Reservations",
    faqs: [
      { q: "Do I need to make a reservation?", a: "We highly recommend booking online in advance to guarantee your preferred date and time. Walk-ins are accepted based on availability, but weekends and peak season fill up fast." },
      { q: "How do I book?", a: "You can book directly through our website by clicking any 'Book Now' button — it takes you to our secure booking system where you can choose your activity, date, and time. You can also call us at (443) 664-6180." },
      { q: "What is your cancellation policy?", a: "We recommend canceling at least 24 hours before your scheduled rental for a full refund. Cancellations within 24 hours may be subject to a fee. If weather forces a cancellation, we will work with you to reschedule." },
      { q: "Do you accept walk-ins?", a: "Yes, walk-ins are welcome! However, availability is not guaranteed — especially during peak summer weekends. Booking ahead is always your best bet." },
      { q: "What payment methods do you accept?", a: "We accept all major credit cards. Payment is processed at the time of booking through our secure online system." },
      { q: "Can I book for a large group?", a: "Absolutely! For groups needing multiple jet skis or pontoon boats, contact us directly and we'll help coordinate your adventure." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Jet Ski Rentals",
    faqs: [
      { q: "How old do you have to be to ride a jet ski?", a: "Passengers must be at least 5 years old. Drivers must be at least 16 with a valid photo ID. Drivers under 18 need a parent or guardian signature." },
      { q: "How many people fit on a jet ski?", a: "Up to 3 people per jet ski — two adults and one child is the recommended maximum. Weight capacity is approximately 450 lbs." },
      { q: "Do I need experience?", a: "No experience needed! Our guides provide a complete safety and instructional briefing before every ride. They accompany you on the water the entire time." },
      { q: "Do I need a boater's license?", a: "No boater's license is required. Maryland regulations require a certified guide to accompany all jet ski rentals, which we provide." },
      { q: "Are life vests provided?", a: "Yes — life vests are mandatory for all riders and are provided free of charge in all sizes." },
      { q: "How long is the ride?", a: "Each jet ski rental is 1 hour of ride time. You should arrive 15-20 minutes early for check-in and your safety briefing." },
      { q: "How fast do the jet skis go?", a: "Our brand new jet skis can reach speeds of 40+ mph depending on conditions and rider weight." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Pontoon Boat Rentals",
    faqs: [
      { q: "How old do you have to be to drive a pontoon?", a: "The driver must be at least 21 years old with a valid driver's license. No boating experience is required — we provide a full orientation before departure." },
      { q: "How many people fit on a pontoon boat?", a: "Up to 10 people per pontoon boat. All ages are welcome." },
      { q: "Are pontoon boats self-guided?", a: "Yes! Unlike jet skis, pontoon boats are self-guided. You're the captain — explore the bay at your own pace." },
      { q: "Can we bring alcohol?", a: "Yes, alcohol is permitted on pontoon boats. The driver must remain sober at all times — no exceptions." },
      { q: "Can we anchor at Assateague Island?", a: "Yes! You can anchor near Assateague Island to watch wild horses, swim at sandbars, or just relax. This is one of the highlights of a pontoon rental." },
      { q: "What's included in the rental?", a: "Each rental includes the pontoon boat with canopy for shade, life vests in all sizes, a full safety orientation, and free parking at our location." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Safety & Weather",
    faqs: [
      { q: "What safety measures do you have?", a: "Safety is our top priority. All jet ski rides include a certified guide. Life vests are mandatory for jet ski riders and available for all pontoon passengers. Our equipment is inspected daily." },
      { q: "What happens if the weather is bad?", a: "We monitor weather conditions closely. If conditions are unsafe, we will contact you to reschedule your rental at no additional cost. Light rain typically doesn't affect operations — we're open rain or shine unless there are dangerous conditions." },
      { q: "Can I ride a jet ski if I've been drinking?", a: "Absolutely not. You may not operate a jet ski or pontoon boat under the influence of alcohol or any other substance. This is strictly enforced for everyone's safety." },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "General",
    faqs: [

      { q: "Is parking free?", a: "Yes! We have free parking available right at our location. No meters, no hassle." },
      { q: "What are your hours?", a: "We're open Monday through Sunday, 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM during the season." },
      { q: "How early should I arrive?", a: "We recommend arriving 15-20 minutes before your scheduled time to complete check-in and your safety briefing." },
